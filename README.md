Projects: Simple Finance Dashboard

Dashboard was created as a way to practice python programming skills, data analytics, and track personal finances with a number of helpful visualizations.

    1. Pulling daily stock data from an API and loading it into MySQL
    2. Add in your own Finance data
    3. Pandas to tidy data
    4. Plot views of tables to create: Unit-Cost graph, Monthly performance, and Cash flow.
    5. Write code for Plotly Dash app (R equivalent to Shiny) and display tables/charts

Current Work in Progress
